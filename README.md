# Candle EA MT4

This code is an Expert Advisor (EA) for MetaTrader 4 (MT4) that is designed to identify and analyze candlestick patterns, implement a trend detection algorithm, make optimal trading decisions based on trend analysis, and set profit and loss limits for trading operations.

## How it Works

The EA is designed to be executed on every tick (price change) in the market. It follows a sequential process to execute trading operations.

1. The `OnTick` function is called on every tick. It calls the following functions in order:
   - `analyzeCandlestickPatterns`
   - `detectTrend`
   - `makeTradingDecisions`
   - `setLimits`

2. The `analyzeCandlestickPatterns` function identifies and analyzes candlestick patterns. The specific code for this analysis is not provided in this code snippet.

3. The `detectTrend` function implements a trend detection algorithm based on the identified candlestick patterns. The specific code for this algorithm is not provided in this code snippet.

4. The `makeTradingDecisions` function makes optimal trading decisions based on the trend analysis. The specific code for making these decisions is not provided in this code snippet.

5. The `setLimits` function sets the profit and loss limits for trading operations. The specific code for setting these limits is not provided in this code snippet.

6. If all the above functions return `true`, the code proceeds to execute trading operations. The specific code for executing trading operations is not provided in this code snippet.

7. The `OnDeinit` function is called for deinitialization tasks. The specific code for handling deinitialization tasks is not provided in this code snippet.

Please note that this code is a sample and does not provide the actual implementation for each function. The code is intended to demonstrate the structure and flow of the EA.
